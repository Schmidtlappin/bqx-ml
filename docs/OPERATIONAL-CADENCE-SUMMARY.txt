OPERATIONAL CADENCE
================================================================================

QUARTERLY:
Q1 End    All Day   → 360 Plan Assessment (ARCH-001)
Q2 End              → 7-dimension comprehensive review
Q3 End              → Goal alignment, gaps, budget, risks
Q4 End              → Decision: Continue/Adjust/Pivot/Pause

SUCCESS METRICS
================================================================================

Operational Excellence:
✅ Repository sync: Complete within 24 hours
✅ Airtable updates: All completed stages have realized cost
✅ Issue resolution: No P0 > 24h, No P1 > 1 week
✅ Plan alignment: Verified quarterly (target > 90%)

Project Health:
🎯 R² (Ensemble): > 0.95 (target)
🎯 API Latency: < 100ms p95 (target)
🎯 Model Drift: 0 alerts (current)
🎯 Budget Variance: ±15% acceptable
🎯 Timeline Variance: ±20% acceptable
🎯 Cost/Month: < $500 (target)

ISSUE PRIORITIZATION
================================================================================

Priority  SLA            Examples
--------  -------------  -------------------------------------------------
P0        24 hours       System down, data loss, critical security
P1        1 week         Major feature broken, R² drop > 0.05
P2        2 weeks        Minor feature broken, small degradation
P3        1 month        Cosmetic issues, nice-to-have improvements

QUARTERLY 360 ASSESSMENT DIMENSIONS
================================================================================

1. Goal Alignment (L4-PRAGMATICS)
   Are we still aligned with "exact prediction of BQX variables"?

2. Technical Gaps
   Missing features, infrastructure limitations, new techniques?

3. Budget & Timeline
   Actual vs estimated costs, ROI assessment

4. Success Criteria Validation
   Are we measuring the right things?

5. Risk Assessment
   New risks, mitigation effectiveness, contingencies

6. Stakeholder Alignment
   User satisfaction, agent capacity, dependencies

7. Industry Trends
   New ML techniques, competitor analysis, market shifts

DECISION FRAMEWORK (360 Assessment)
================================================================================

Alignment > 90%, No gaps       → Continue as planned
Alignment 70-90%, Minor gaps   → Adjust tactics (small corrections)
Alignment 50-70%, Moderate gaps → Pivot strategy (significant changes)
Alignment < 50%, Major gaps    → Pause & re-evaluate fundamentals

AUTOMATION & TOOLS
================================================================================

Airtable:
- Weekly reminders: Friday 3pm → COORD-001 (plan updates due)
- Bi-weekly reminders: 14th & last day → QA-001 (issue review tomorrow)
- Quarterly reminders: 3 weeks before Q end → ARCH-001 (360 coming up)

GitHub Actions:
- Repository sync workflow (triggered on Airtable webhook)
- Documentation build (auto-generate status from Airtable)
- Release tagging (auto-tag on phase completion)

Monitoring:
- CloudWatch Dashboard: bqx-ml-operational-health
- Slack Channel: #bqx-ml-operations
- SNS Alerts: Operational issues (missed sync, overdue reviews)
