## 🔍 CLEANUP PROCESS DETAILS

### Deletion Strategy

1. **Identification:**
   - Queried all stages with Stage Code = "NO CODE"
   - Verified 17 obsolete placeholders from phases 1.5, 2, 3
   - Confirmed no active project stages would be deleted

2. **Execution:**
   - Deleted stages one by one via AirTable API
   - Applied rate limiting (5 requests per second)
   - Monitored success/failure for each deletion

3. **Verification:**
   - Confirmed all 17 deletions successful
   - Verified 83 active stages remain
   - Validated enhancement and critical stages intact

### Safety Measures

- ✅ Identified placeholders by "NO CODE" Stage Code
- ✅ Verified obsolete status before deletion
- ✅ Rate limited to avoid API errors
- ✅ Monitored each deletion for success
- ✅ Final verification of remaining stages

### Result

**100% Success Rate:**
- 17/17 placeholders deleted
- 0 failed deletions
- 0 active stages accidentally removed
